# SamKnows Test App by Aramide

To test the app, import it into your an IDE (Eclipse STS / Intellij / Eclipse for Web etc)

Once imported, you should be able to right-click on the project and select 'Run As > Java Application' and select 'App' as the Main class.

There are JUnit tests included which test the 'average, min, max, median and periods' for the input data, which can be
executed by selecting right-click on the project and select 'Run As > JUnit Test' and the tests should execute.

The 'input' data is loaded before each test automatically

Input data files can be found under src/main/resources

You can find the result / output results under '\logs\outputs.txt' which will contain the metrics analysis results
